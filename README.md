# Cross-Domain Image Colorization
This project colorizes images based on domains like Grayscale, Sketch, and Infrared using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter.

## Features
- GUI for image upload
- Domain-specific colorization
- Save colorized output

## How to Run

## âœ… **Step 3: Initialize Git Locally**
Open **Command Prompt / Terminal** in your project folder:
```bash
cd path/to/cross-domain-image-colorization
git init
git remote add origin [https://github.com/yourusername/cross-domain-image-colorization.git]
```


# Task 
### Visualizing the Colorization Process. Description: Visualize the intermediate stages of your model's colorization process to better understand how the image transitions from grayscale to color. Guidelines: Use visual tools to demonstrate how colorization progresses across your model's layers or stages. GUI is not necessary.
